Certain python packages will not install with user privileges in Stampede.  Sometimes the command `pip install --user` will work.  A better method especially when developing an Agave app is to use the command `pip install --install-option="--prefix=$PREFIX_PATH" package_name `. Using a `lib` directory would make sense in this instance for containing your dependencies. So if I were developing on Stampede2 inside of $WORK/apps/my-app, I would load my favorite flavor of python (e.g. `module load python`) and then run `pip install --install-option="--prefix=$WORK/apps/my-app/lib" package_name`. once my test scripts were working, I would make the `lib` directory (and probably a `bin` directory) into tarballs. `tar czf lib.tgz ./lib` then, in my wrapper script, I would untar as the first step, and delete it as the last step.

```
tar xzf lib.tgz
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/lib"

do my workflow here

rm -r $PWD/lib
```
